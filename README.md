- Serialization/Deserialization 
	- how do we perform in Java
	- Suppose we have a Employee class and we do not want to serialize few fields how could we achieve this ?
- Hash code always returning 1 and equals is having fname and lname what should be map size when we put 5 elements.

	- Is A
	- Has A
- count the no. of consecutive number in the numeric string

- default hashcode by Object class
- Immutable class
- Usecase of Immutable class
- What will happen when one method is static synchronise and another is one on synchronize method, what will have when 2 threads run on both the methds
- Executor service and thread pools
